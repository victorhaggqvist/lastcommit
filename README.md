# Last commit widget
### You are only as good as your last commit

JavaScript widget to include on your site that shows and links to your last commit on GitHub.
This is [Johan Nilsson](https://github.com/johannilsson/lastcommit)'s last commit widget but with no need for jQuery.

``` html
<span class="lastcommit-widget" data-user="your github username"></span>
<script src="//victorhaggqvist.github.io/lastcommit/lastcommit.min.js"></script>
```

* Does not work properly on commits in branches.
